Running the Game

The Story
---------

A fourth dragon (duck), not in the original Atari VCS 2600 Adventure has captured back the chalice and hid it at the end of a long cavern. The dragon has organized characters from past Atari games to help keep you out of the cavern. Each nemesis is armed with unlimited bullets, so watch out. At the end the dragon is guarding the chalice, he has given them the order "You can't let him in here." Unfortunately your old Atari joystick is worn out and all you have left is the fire button (the space bar on your keyboard). Being the brave, yet very square, knight you are, you swallowed the magnet causing you to be pulled down the cavern towards the chalice. Working to your advantage, your worn out Atari also has a glitch that gives you unlimited lives and no timeout so you can keep going until you reach the end.


How to Play
-----------

Use the space bar to jump over the obstacles. Don't hit the obstacles, bullets, or the nemeses.
